# Dhan Calculator – Risk Management & Position Sizing Tool 💹  

A practical Excel-based **risk management and position sizing calculator** for intraday and delivery traders.  
This tool calculates your **true, post-tax Risk:Reward**, factoring in brokerage charges and transaction taxes using Dhan’s fee structure — something most traders ignore.

It ensures disciplined risk management and accurate position sizing for every trade.

## 🔥 Key Features

### **1️⃣ Automatic Position Sizing**
Based on:
- Total Trading Capital  
- % Risk per Trade  
- Leverage Used  
- Stock LTP  
- Desired Risk : Reward Ratio  

The sheet calculates:
- Maximum position size  
- Quantity to trade  
- Gross & Net P/L  
- True risk amount  

---

### **2️⃣ True Risk–Reward After Taxes**
Most traders calculate RR **before charges**.  
This calculator gives your **REAL RR after:**  
- Brokerage  
- STT  
- Exchange Charges  
- GST  
- SEBI Fees  
- Stamp Duty  

You’ll finally know your *actual* profitability.

---

### **3️⃣ Full Brokerage & Tax Breakdown (Order Estimator Tab)**
The second tab includes:
- Buy-side & Sell-side cost breakdown  
- Target-hit vs Stop Loss-hit calculations  
- All charges as per **Dhan (Equity/NSE)**  
- Total cost on both outcomes  

This helps you check the real impact of costs on each trade.

---

### **4️⃣ Daily Ledger (Auto Balance Tracker)**
Automatically logs:
- Trade number  
- P&L  
- Balance  
- Running returns  
- Daily gains/losses  

Useful for consistency tracking and journaling.

## 📝 How to Use

### **1. Only Edit BLUE Cells**
Editable inputs (BLUE font):
- Your Capital  
- Risk %  
- LTP  
- Desired Risk:Reward  
- Order Type (Buy/Sell)  
- Type of Trade 

⚠️ **Do NOT edit cells in black/green/orange — those contain formulas.**

---

### **2. Let the Sheet Auto-Calculate**
Once inputs are filled, the model computes:
- Ideal Position Size  
- Quantity  
- Max allowed position  
- Gross & Net profit/loss  
- Practical RR (after taxes)  

---

### **3. Use the Order Estimator Tab**
View:
- All brokerage components  
- Total charges after Target Hit  
- Total charges after Stop Loss Hit  

This tab handles all Dhan-specific taxes.

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Excel Error Fix  
When opening for the first time, Excel may show:

- **Circular reference warning**  
- Or formulas not updating  

This happens because the sheet uses **iterative logic** for position sizing.

### ✅ To Fix:
1. Go to **File → Options**  
2. Click **Formulas**  
3. Under *Calculation Options* →  
   ✔ Tick **Enable iterative calculations**  
4. Press **OK**  

The model will work perfectly afterwards.

## 🎯 Why This Tool Matters
Every trader talks about:
- “RR 2:1 hai”  
- “Setup strong hai”  
- “Accuracy high hai”  

But almost NO ONE checks:
- **RR after taxes**  
- **Net profit after charges**  
- **Practical vs theoretical RR**  

This calculator bridges that gap and makes your trading realistic & professional.
